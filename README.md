# final-exam
- From the starting code, polygon_art.py, you are to write an OO program that generates different pieces of art works
- Fork, then, clone this repo
- Read the instructions given in the course's Google Classroom and start coding
- Once you are done, push your final code to your Github repo and modify this README to report on the work you have done
## Changes made

- Implemented new Class called ArtSimulator for running the program
- Implemented method for class ArtSimulator
- Implemented Art1 to Art4 

### How this program run
